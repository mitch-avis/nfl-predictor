# ARCHIVE - Completed Milestones

This file contains completed milestones and optional enhancements that were previously tracked in
`TODO.md`. Keep this as the audit trail. If future changes regress behavior, re-run the acceptance
checks from the relevant section.

## Completed core milestones (0-11)

> These items were completed and verified in prior work. They are archived here to keep `TODO.md`
> focused on active work.

### Milestone 0 - Repo scan & plan

- [x] Identify ML entrypoints (train, predict, backtest scripts).
- [x] Identify where margin/total and win prob calibration live.
- [x] List current artifact outputs and missing metadata.
- [x] Confirm where ML datasets and week prediction inputs are produced.

### Milestone 1 - Canonical Margin/Total pipeline

- [x] Margin/total modeling is the primary path.
- [x] Score derivation is stable and unit-tested.
- [x] Outputs include margin/total and derived scores.

### Milestone 2 - Preprocessing cleanup

- [x] XGBoost path avoids scaling and avoids accidental densification.
- [x] Missing values are handled intentionally.

### Milestone 3 - Training improvements

- [x] Early stopping is enabled.
- [x] `eval_metric` aligns to the optimization target.
- [x] Parallelism is configurable.
- [x] Training config is serialized into metadata.

### Milestone 4 - Walk-forward evaluation

- [x] Walk-forward backtest exists and is time-aware.
- [x] Per-week and per-season metrics are emitted.

### Milestone 5 - Probability calibration + diagnostics

- [x] Calibration options are implemented.
- [x] Brier/log loss and reliability summaries are reported.

### Milestone 6 - Quantile intervals

- [x] Margin and total include p10/p50/p90 outputs.
- [x] Interval columns exist and are validated.

### Milestone 7 - Market transforms + anchoring

- [x] Market transforms are explicit and configurable.
- [x] Market anchoring is supported.
- [x] Market probability blending/clamping exists as configured.

### Milestone 8 - Leakage audit

- [x] Leakage audit mode exists and emits a JSON report.
- [x] Tests verify detection of leaked columns.

### Milestone 9 - Artifact contract + metadata

- [x] Run directories include model + metadata + metrics report.
- [x] Artifacts are loadable without hidden state.

### Milestone 10 - Golden command entrypoint

- [x] One command runs train + backtest + weekly predictions and writes artifacts.

### Milestone 11 - Dependency pinning + documentation

- [x] ML dependencies are pinned.
- [x] CPU-only path works and is documented.

## Completed optional enhancements

- [x] Realistic score post-processing for display outputs.
- [x] Market-only model removed when anchoring sufficed.
- [x] Blending weights constrained where applicable.
- [x] Interval coverage diagnostics implemented.
